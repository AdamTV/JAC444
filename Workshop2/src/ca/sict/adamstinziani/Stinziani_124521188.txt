In this workshop I continued practicing my basic java coding skills by creating 
classes and methods using arrays.

I avoided creating a utility class by implementing non-static methods such as the
constructors and getIncomeTax(). My original implementation contained all static 
methods and made no use of the constructors, when I tried instantiating IncomeTax 
is when I learned I had created a utility class. 

Refactoring fixed the problem, moved validation logic into the constructor and 
avoided the use of utility classes.

Instructions on how to run code: 
from cmd in parent directory of 'ca':

javac ./ca/sict/adamstinziani/*.java

echo Main-Class: ca.sict.adamstinziani.Workshop >./ca/sict/adamstinziani/manifest.txt

jar -cvfm ./ca/sict/adamstinziani/Workshop2.jar ./ca/sict/adamstinziani/manifest.txt ./ca/sict/adamstinziani/*.class

java -jar ./ca/sict/adamstinziani/Workshop2.jar
