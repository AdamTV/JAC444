In this workshop I continued practicing my basic Java coding skills by creating 
a GUI and working with event handlers as well as using lambda expressions again
and the collection framework.

The HashMap class in Java has the same functionaly of the Dictionary class in C#
and I have a lot of practice working with Dictionaries so I am familiar with
HashMaps. Instead of using a collection that would easily be able to remove
duplicates from itself, I did it myself.
