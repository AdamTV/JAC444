=======================
This week I revisited Java and created a program using: classes, methods, single and two-dimensional arrays. 

I have studied Java and spent a year at my Co-Op mainly working with the .NET Framework so classes and methods are nothing new to me, however the sytnax will take some getting used to. 

My key takeaway from this workshop is that two-dimensional arrays cannot be initialized with a row or column size of zero. This will throw a run-time error and for this reason I added logic in my code to handle this scenario.
